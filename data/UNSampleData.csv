Reporter 1,Volunteer 1,83984814,10/2/2014 12:15,"My boyfriend just left me and I know consciously he is an abuser, but I want to call him so bad. It is like an addiction. How can I break that?"
Volunteer 1,Reporter 1,83984814,10/2/2014 12:15,I suggest you take this time to focus on yourself if you can. Work on revisiting your family of origin to discover why you chose an abusive partner. Try to reconnect with old friends and make new ones. Try to keep yourself occupied in positive ways instead of allowing yourself to obsess about him.
Reporter 2,Volunteer 2,87581427,3/2/2014 15:23,"My husband will never leave me. He wouldn't have anyone to control. He's never hit me, but he has gotten violent and scared me. Yes, he refuses to believe he is abusive, then he is nice, then it starts all over again. He has my head spinning in circles. These bruises don't heal."
Volunteer 2,Reporter 2,87581427,3/2/2014 15:24,"Yes, some women find comfort in the fact that a man will never leave them. These are usually women who were abandoned in some way when they were growing up - emotionally or physically. But again, the price you pay for knowing he will never leave you can be your very sanity."
Reporter 2,Volunteer 2,87581427,3/2/2014 15:24,How can you overcome the fear to take the first step? To stand up to someone is my biggest fear.
Volunteer 2,Reporter 2,87581427,3/2/2014 15:25,†I understand. Fear can be crippling. Perhaps you aren't quite ready to stand up to someone yet. Perhaps you need more time to heal from the emotional abuse from your past and to gain more self-confidence by surrounding yourself with supportive people.
Volunteer 2,Reporter 2,87581427,3/2/2014 15:25,Keep trying Beth. It takes time to gain the courage and confidence to stand up for yourself. You can start by leaving a room or your home when the abuse begins. That way you won't be adding more abuse to your already wounded soul.
Reporter 3,Volunteer 3,87152629,26/3/2014 19:02,"My husband can be so nice when he wants, or I should say, when he feels he is losing me. I feel like he throws the line out and reels me in repeatedly. I'm still in denial about being abused because it doesn't happen†all†the time, but he has threatened me and threatened to take my daughter. He's got me right where he wants me. I'm scared to come home. I never know if he will be happy or mad. I have learned how NOT to set him off - by keeping my mouth shut. "
Volunteer 3,Reporter 3,87152629,26/3/2014 19:02,"Yes, when an abuser threatens to take your children they do have you where they want you, but in most cases, that is all it is - a threat. Legally, he more than likely will be unable to gain full custody of your child."
Reporter 3,Volunteer 3,87152629,26/3/2014 19:02,"I keep telling myself I need more time also, but I keep getting depressed."
Volunteer 3,Reporter 3,87152629,26/3/2014 19:02,The longer you stay in the relationship the less strength and courage you'll have to leave. And you do need to consider your daughter's welfare. She is being emotionally abused by being in his presence as he abuses you. She is learning very bad lessons about relationships by watching you and your husband interact.
Volunteer 3,Reporter 3,87152629,26/3/2014 19:02,I know it is difficult but you do need to continue working on coming out of denial and you need to seek some help. A good therapist will help you gain the strength to leave.†I am concerned about the fact that you say you are depressed. This is not a good sign at all. Please seek some help.
Reporter 4,Volunteer 4,97152521,17/6/2014 8:34,"I was abused many times as a child. Recently, I was assaulted by a stranger and I want to know how these people find me. I feel so afraid and alone."
Volunteer 4,Reporter 4,97152521,17/6/2014 8:34,"It is not your fault! Yet somehow, and you probably don't know how you are doing it, but you are sending out messages that you are fearful. This may be your body posture, closing yourself in front with your arms, the way you look at someone, or other non-intentional ways that you show you are powerless, however, this is correctable! "
Reporter 5,Volunteer 5,89178614,8/8/2014 17:55,"Iím very sad. Why have employers like this? They treat you like animals, not like humans"
Volunteer 5,Reporter 5,89178614,8/8/2014 17:55,Iím so sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a little more about what your employers are saying?
Reporter 6,Volunteer 6,85252114,8/8/2014 19:39,"I thought I should report my neighbours. They would start to hit the aunty when there are no people around, I canít bear to see the aunty like this. I told her to stop. In front of other people they never do this. "
Volunteer 6,Reporter 6,85252114,8/8/2014 19:42,"Thank you for being the one willing to take action to protect a vulnerable adult. You should call your local police. This can be done anonymously. Reporting can seem like a drastic measure. However, reporting allows trained professionals to review the situation and put protective actions in place as needed. It opens the door for other services to help support your neighborís family."
